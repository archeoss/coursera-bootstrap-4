# "Digital University"

## 1. Introduction

A brief introduction to website idea.

A website for Bauman Moscow State Technical University (BMSTU), that provides students their current progress in education. 

Today's approach to education sometimes just simply couldn't keep up with bleeding-edge technologies. Many websites are outdated, their lack of features makes them useless, and their design is far from being called "responsive". So what are we gonna do then? Make our own website, of course. To the brighter future of web development and beyond! Or something like that.

Many students are *suffering* because they just can't track their progress in an adequate way, teachers as well can't provide that information because of bureaucracy and the lack of communication with their students. So, in that case, we need to provide those instruments to make every group in University happy.

## 2. Expected List of Features

"Digital University" could provide

- 1 - Ability to see students' current progress
- 2 - Ability to fill official applications
- 3 - Time restrictions for teachers
- 4 - Website will provide necessary information about students: Specialization, years of education, current grants, etc.
- 5 - Information about University, open vacancies for students, possible grants, information about volunteers working within and outside of the University

That website will be useful for both students and teachers since both of these groups could effectively track students' progress. The Website could also provide a certain amount of services to ease the bureaucracy between the students and administration, e.g. filling different kinds of applications or claims

The teachers could easily track students' current progress, but at the same time, there will be an obligation to mark all the works (labs, assignments, etc.) in time, so the students could see their current progress

## 3. Market Survey

Although there is currently a "Digital University" provided in BMSTU, as being said earlier, it lacks nearly of everything: from necessary features to responsive design, so it needs a total overhaul

We also can't take it from other universities, such as Oxford or MIT for example, because those universities don't provide such services

Different kinds of applications, such as Google Classrooms or Moodle, could provide something similar with few features, but in the big scales we need a totally different approach, also those applications are not designed for official documentation within the University
